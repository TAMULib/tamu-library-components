of and perpendicular to Weaver Components.\nThis either extends components, providing custom styles, or provides entirely new components.\nInstallation\nTAMU Library Components may be installed by either referencing a CDN or by using NpmJs.\nInstallation via NpmJs\nThe latest pre-built package may be found in the TAMU Library Elements NpmJs Repository.\nUsing the npm command (from NpmJs), install this project as a dependency to an existing project:\nnpm install @wvr/tl-elementsInstallation via CDN\nThe files tl-components.js and styles.css need to be available on some server.\nSee the Building section below for details on how to build these files.\nThe CSS file should be added as an HTML  element to the HTML  element, such as:\n\n  \n    \n  \nThe Javascript file should be added an HTML  element to the HTML  element at the very end, such as:\n\n  \n    ...\n    \n  \nBuilding\nTo build this project use the npm command (from NpmJs).\nThis project can be built to run locally for development purposes be built to get the tl-components.js and styles.css files needed to run on a CDN.\nMore detailed documentation about the build process may be found via the referenced links in the Documentation section below.\nBuilding the tl-components.js and the styles.css\nThe tl-components.js and the styles.css files are needed if intending to utilize this project via a CDN.\nThese files are built using the build command from within the project root directory:\n  cd tamu-library-components\n  npm run buildOnce this has successfully completed the tl-components.js and styles.css files should be located under the dist/bundle/ sub-directory:\n  dist/bundle/styles.css\n  dist/bundle/tl-components.jsBuilding for a NpmJs Package\nBuilding this for a NpmJs Package is the same as building this for a CDN.\nThese files are built using the build command from within the project root directory:\n  cd tamu-library-components\n  npm run buildBuilding against a Local Weaver Components\nWhen wanting to run against a locally built Weaver Components, the Verdaccio service in Weaver Components should be used.\nFollow the Weaver Components documentation to set this up.\nOnce Weaver Components is properly set up, the npm-local command can be used to fetch only the local Weaver Components from the Verdaccio service.\nThe npm install command will overwrite the local version which will result in loss of changes made by npm-local.\nOnce Weaver Components is properly setup, the build and even start commands may be performed.\n  npm install\n  npm run npm-local\n  npm run build\n  npm run startDocumentation\nDetailed documentation may be found:\n\nUsage Documentation\nDevelopment Documentation\nWiki\n\nDetailed reports may be
